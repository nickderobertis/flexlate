#  flexlate

## Overview

Flexlate is a composable, maintainable system for managing templates.

### Features

- Update existing template outputs after there are changes to the template
  - When there is a conflict, it creates a git merge conflict so that you can
    resolve it with your favorite tooling
  - It keeps a history of the conflict resolution so you are not resolving 
    the same conflicts repeatedly
- Compose a project with multiple templates
  - Add template sources and then you can apply outputs anywhere with a simple 
    CLI command
- Use your existing templates: both [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) 
  and [`copier`](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) templates are supported
- Apply it to your existing projects with a `bootstrap` functionality

### Why Flexlate?

Flexlate is born out of frustration with using project templates. 
You generate your project from a template, but later update the template 
and need to bring the changes back to your project. There are only a 
few tools for this and they do not have a great developer experience. 
Flexlate is Git-native, so you resolve template conflicts in Git as you would any 
other merge conflicts. 

Further, there is not really any ability to compose a project template from 
smaller templates with any existing tools.

## Getting Started

### Installing

Flexlate is a Python package that includes the `fxt` command line utility. 
If you do not have Python, you will need to [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
first (required version is `>=3.8`).

The recommended way to install Flexlate is with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx),
though it can also be installed with `pip`.

```
pipx install flexlate
```

Or, if you don't have/don't want to install `pipx`:

```
pip install flexlate
```
