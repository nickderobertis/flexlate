# Installing Flexlate

Flexlate is a Python package that includes the `fxt` command line utility. 
If you do not have Python, you will need to [install it](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
first (required version is `>=3.8`).

The recommended way to install Flexlate is with [`pipx`](https://github.com/pypa/pipx),
though it can also be installed with `pip`.

```
pipx install flexlate
```

Or, if you don't have/don't want to install `pipx`:

```
pip install flexlate
```

Before using Flexlate, you will also need to have 
[Git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
